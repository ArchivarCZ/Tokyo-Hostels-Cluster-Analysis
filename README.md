# Tokyo-Hostels-Cluster-Analysis

This analysis was done before the summer olympics in Tokyo in the hopes to get more information on the hostels in the city. We use the Japan hostel dataset, Foursquare API and we create dataset for Tokyo land prices by webscraping. We prepare the data for the analysis. Using folium we create interactive maps and in the end we create clusters of hostels using kmeans.
